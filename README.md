## Dependencies

To launch this project, you will need:

- Docker and docker-compose installed. Follow the link [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker and [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to install docker-compose.
- npm and Node.js installed. Follow the link [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/) to install them.

## Launching the application

First launch the backend application by changing directory to the `backend` folder in this folder in a new terminal window. Then execute the following command in the new window:

```bash
docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```

Then wait for the backend to be launched. You should see something like this in the logs:

```bash
web_1      | [2021-04-08 11:55:11 +0000] [7] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.0.4
web_1      | [2021-04-08 11:55:11 +0000] [7] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:5000 (7)

web_1      | [2021-04-08 11:55:11 +0000] [12] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 12
```

Once you see that, open another terminal window and change directory to this folder. Launch the front-end by running the following:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000 npm start
```

The web application should open in your default browser, and you can start changing some of the values to use the app, or key in your own values.

## Frontend Project dependencies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Dependencies used:

- The library used for this project is [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- This project used [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) for the state management together with [React-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) for the middleware
- [Formilk](https://formik.org/) is used for the form validation
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) is used for generating the chart
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) is used for setting the mock server and establish the API contract with backend. The collection can be found by importing cash_mock_server.json in the root folder to the Postman app.
